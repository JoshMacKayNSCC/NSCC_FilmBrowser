# PROG2500 - Movie Explorer WPF Application Project

## Project Description

Our team proposes a **Movie Explorer WPF application**, utilizing the **IMDB SQL Server database**. This app aims to present extensive movie data in an accessible format, highlighting WPF features like data binding, XAML UI design, and LINQ queries.

## Application Wireframe

The wireframe maps the user journey across four main pages:

- **Home Page**: A dynamic interface with key highlights and navigation.
- **Movie Catalog Page**: Allows users to filter and select movies.
- **Actor Info Page**: Provides detailed information about actors.
- **Director’s Cut Page**: Focuses on directors and their filmographies.

## Basic Workplan
